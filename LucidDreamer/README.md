## üéè Abstract

We present a text-to-3D generation framework, named the *LucidDreamer*, to distill high-fidelity textures and shapes from pretrained 2D diffusion models.

> The recent advancements in text-to-3D generation mark a significant milestone in generative models, unlocking new possibilities for creating imaginative 3D assets across various real-world scenarios. While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our model largely outperforms the state-of-the-art in quality and training efficiency.

## üîß Training Instructions

Our code is now released! Please refer to this [**link**](resources/Training_Instructions.md) for detailed training instructions.

## ü§ó Gradio Demo

We are currently building an online demo of LucidDreamer with Gradio, you can check it out by clicking this [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/haodongli/LucidDreamer). It is still under development, and the service might not be available from time to time. 

## üöß Todo

- [x] Release the basic training codes
- [x] Release the guidance documents
- [ ] Release the training codes for more applications
